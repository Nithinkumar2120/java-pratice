# Java Practice Programs

This repository contains my practice programs in *Java*.  
It includes basic programs, OOP examples, and small console applications.

## Structure

- basics/ – simple Java programs (Hello World, calculator, loops, etc.)
- oops/ – programs using classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, etc.

More programs will be added as I learn and practice Java.
